        <p>

          <br>

        <p>
          Herbivorous animals, also known as herbivores, are a fascinating group of creatures that play a crucial role
          in the balance of ecosystems around the world. These animals have evolved to primarily consume plant matter as
          their main source of nutrition. From the mighty elephants of Africa to the gentle cows grazing in meadows,
          herbivores exhibit a diverse range of adaptations and behaviors.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          One remarkable characteristic of herbivores is their specialized digestive systems, which enable them to
          efficiently extract nutrients from plants. Many herbivores have long digestive tracts and multiple stomach
          chambers to break down cellulose, a complex carbohydrate found in plant cell walls. Some herbivores, such as
          cows and deer, have even formed a mutualistic relationship with microorganisms in their digestive system that
          aid in the fermentation and digestion of plant materials.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          Herbivores can be found in various habitats worldwide, ranging from lush rainforests to arid grasslands. They
          have evolved different feeding strategies to adapt to their environments. For instance, grazers like zebras
          and
          bison consume grasses by grazing on the ground, while browsers like giraffes and koalas feed on leaves and
          shoots from trees and shrubs. Some herbivores, like rabbits and squirrels, are considered opportunistic
          feeders,
          consuming a wide range of plant materials depending on availability.

          <span class="animal-type">Elephant</span> Elephants are the largest herbivores on land, known for their
          impressive size and long trunks. They
          consume a variety of vegetation, including grasses, leaves, and fruits, and play a crucial role in shaping
          their habitats through their feeding and browsing behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="animal-type">Giraffe</span> With their long necks and specialized tongues, giraffes are expert
          browsers, feeding on the leaves
          and shoots of trees and shrubs. They can reach heights of up to 18 feet, allowing them to access food sources
          that are unavailable to other herbivores.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="animal-type">Deer</span> Deer are widely distributed herbivores found in various habitats around
          the world. They primarily feed
          on plant foliage, including grasses, leaves, and twigs. Antlers, present in males, are used for mating rituals
          and territorial displays.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="animal-type">Cow</span> Cows belong to the family Bovidae (hollow-horned ruminants, which also
          includes antelope, sheep, and goats), subfamily Bovinae. They are domesticated herbivorous animals that are
          commonly raised for their meat and milk. They are
          ruminants, possessing a multi-chambered stomach that allows them to digest fibrous plant material, such as
          grasses and hay.

          <br>

        <p>
          A carnivore is an organism that mostly eats meat, or the flesh of animals. Sometimes carnivores are called
          predators. Organisms that carnivores hunt are called prey. Carnivores are a major part of the food web, a
          description of which organisms eat which other organisms in the wild.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called hypercarnivores or
          obligate carnivores, while those that also consume non-animal food are called mesocarnivores, or facultative
          carnivores. A carnivore at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator, regardless of whether it is
          an obligate or
          facultative carnivore.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          Characteristics commonly associated with carnivores include strength, speed, and keen senses for hunting, as
          well as teeth and claws for capturing and tearing prey. However, some carnivores do not hunt and are
          scavengers, lacking the physical characteristics to bring down prey; in addition, most hunting carnivores will
          scavenge when the opportunity arises.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
          Most mammalian carnivores have their eyes in front of their face, which increases depth perception. It is
          common for these animals to have sharp teeth and claws to tear flesh effectively.

          Well-known carnivores include Big Cats, reptiles like snakes and crocodiles, sharks, canids, and birds of
          prey. The rarest carnivore alive today is the Ethiopian wolf.

    <section class="columns">
      <p><span class="carnivouros-name">Polar Bear</span> Its native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle,
        encompassing the Arctic Ocean and its surrounding seas and landmasses, which includes the northernmost regions
        of North America and Eurasia. It is the largest extant bear species, as well as the largest extant land
        carnivore. </p>

      <br>

      <p><span class="carnivouros-name">Lion</span> The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs and shrublands. It is
        usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at
        twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia from Southeast Europe to
        India.</p>

      <br>

      <p><span class="carnivouros-name">Fossa</span> The fossa is the largest mammalian carnivore on Madagascar and has
        been compared to a small cougar, as it has convergently evolved many cat-like features. Adults have a head-body
        length of 70–80 cm (28–31 in) and weigh between 5.5 and 8.6 kg (12 and 19 lb), with the males larger than the
        females. </p>

      <br>

      <p><span class="carnivouros-name">Leopard</span> The leopard was first described in 1758, and several subspecies
        were proposed in the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, eight subspecies are recognised in its wide range in Africa
        and Asia. It probably evolved in Africa about 0.5 to 0.8 million years ago and radiated across Asia about 0.2
        and 0.3 million years ago.</p>

      <br>

      <p><span class="carnivouros-name">Fox</span> Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and
        widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies. The global
        distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their
        prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world.</p>

      <br>

      <p><span class="carnivouros-name">Cheetah</span> The cheetah lives in three main social groups: females and their
        cubs, male "coalitions", and solitary males. While females lead a nomadic life searching for prey in large home
        ranges, males are more sedentary and instead establish much smaller territories in areas with plentiful prey and
        access to females. The cheetah is active during the day, with peaks during dawn and dusk.</p>

      <br>

      <p><span class="carnivouros-name">Kodkod</span> The kodkod's fur color ranges from brownish-yellow to grey-brown.
        It has dark spots, a pale underside and a ringed tail. The ears are black with a white spot, while the dark
        spots on the shoulders and neck almost merge to form a series of dotted streaks. The kodkod is strongly
        associated with mixed temperate rainforests of the southern Andean and coastal ranges.</p>

      <br>

      <p><span class="carnivouros-name">Lion</span> The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs and shrublands. It is
        usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at
        twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia from Southeast Europe to
        India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western
        India. </p>

      <br>

      <p><span class="carnivouros-name">Jaguar</span> The jaguar (Panthera onca) is a large cat species and the only
        living member of the genus Panthera native to the Americas. With a body length of up to 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in) and a
        weight of up to 158 kg (348 lb), it is the largest cat species in the Americas and the third largest in the
        world. </p>

      <br>

      <p><span class="carnivouros-name">Wolf</span> The wolf is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. More
        than thirty subspecies of it have been recognized. The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae,
        and is further distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter
        torso and a longer tail. Its populations consist of packs and lone wolves. </p>
